            <p className="about__body">
            I am a Master of Science (M.S.) student in Artificial Intelligence at Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran, and I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering there with a GPA of 3.93/4. 
            <br/  >
            I joined the <b className="section__blue">NLP lab</b> during the third year of my BSc studies, where we worked on “identification and word embedding of Persian verbal multiword expressions”. 
            <br/>
            Currently, I as a <b className="section__blue">Computer Vision researcher</b>, I am working on my MSc thesis entitled “Personalized Image Tag Refinement by Leveraging Knowledge Graphs(KGs)”. 
            <br/>
            During the past three years I gained more experience in the industry by working as a <b className="section__blue">Front-End developer</b>.
            I am interested in developing web applications with Javascript libraries and frameworks like <b className="section__blue">React</b> and <b className="section__blue">Angular</b>.              
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Regarding research interest, I am genuinely passionate about using NLP and Computer Vision techniques to address a wide range of theoretical and application issues, such as improving the performance of multimodal representation learning methods, and recommender systems.
