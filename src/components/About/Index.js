            </h1>
            <p className="about__body">
            I am a Master of Science (M.S.) student in Artificial Intelligence at Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran, and I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering there with a GPA of 3.93/4. 
            <br/  ><br/>
            I joined the <b className="section__blue">NLP lab</b> during the third year of my BSc studies, where we worked on compositionality of Persian verbal multiword expressions. 
            <br/>
            Currently, I as a <b className="section__blue">Computer Vision researcher</b>, I am working on my MSc thesis entitled “Personalized Image Tag Refinement by Leveraging Knowledge Graphs(KGs)”. 
            <br/>
            I bring over three years of expertise as a Java Back-End developer, specializing in crafting payment applications using <b className="section__blue">Spring Boot</b>. Additionally, 
            I have about two years of experience working with <b className="section__blue">React</b> and <b className="section__blue">Angular </b> for Front-End development. 
            This combined skill set allows me to seamlessly integrate robust back-end functionality with compelling front-end interfaces.           
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Regarding research interest, I am genuinely passionate about using NLP and Computer Vision techniques  to enhance multimodal representation learning and revolutionize recommender systems.
